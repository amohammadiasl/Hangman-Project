# Hangman Game
Welcome to the Hangman Game repository, a C++ implementation created as part of my honors project. 
This classic word-guessing game challenges players to uncover a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. 
Switch cases have been implemented in this version of the game to make the code much easier to follow. 
A list of words has been provided with the game.
